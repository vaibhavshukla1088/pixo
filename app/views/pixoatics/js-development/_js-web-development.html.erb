            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6 ">
                <div class="js-text1 boxsec">

                    </div>
                    <p class="">React is a remarkable tool for building nearly any component in a web application – buttons, labels, texts, or even grids. The best part is code reusability. You don’t have to rewrite everything to add a new feature or apply some changes. This speeds up the development process, reduces costs, and boosts performance.</p>

                <div class="js-text1 boxsec">
                    <div class="d-flex">
                        
                        <h1 class="">Performance</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p class="">Even the most complex solution runs fast and smoothly with React. The technology uses virtual DOMs that selectively render elements of an app. Such an approach favors optimization, allowing the software to function effectively on any device.</p>

                <div class="js-text1 boxsec">
                    <div class="d-flex">
                        
                        <h1 class="">SEO-friendliness</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p class="">Thanks to fast performance and meaningful structure, React-based apps have a better chance to rank high in search engines. Together with server-rendering, all these features ensure pages’ quick loading and indexing of every piece of content by search engines’ bots.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="">Testing React apps is easy due to the technology’s peculiarities. Our testers can easily track the performance of your UI with click events (special JavaScript elements) to ensure the layout is simple to use, effective, and flawless. Apart from that, there also are multiple options for technical testing with both manual & automated methods.</p>
